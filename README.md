# Allyn, A Recommender Assistant for Online Bookstores

Recommender Systems are information ﬁltering engines used to estimate user preferences on items they have not seen: books, movies, restaurants or other things for which individuals have dierent tastes. Collaborative and Content-based Filtering have been the two popular memory-based methods to retrieve recommendations but these suer from some limitations and might fail to provide eective recommendations. In this project we present several variations of Artiﬁcial Neural Networks, and in particular, of Autoencoders to generate model-based predictions for the users. We empirically show that a hybrid approach combining this model with other ﬁltering engines provides a promising solution when compared to a standalone memory-based Collaborative Filtering Recommender. To wrap up the project, a chatbot connected to an e-commerce platform has been implemented so that, using Artiﬁcial Intelligence, it can retrieve recommendations to users.
